# 🤳 Quick QR Token System

We are solving a small but big issue of our college, i.e, NIT Jalandhar. "Snackers"- the largest canteen of our college, calls for order after preparing. It feels very unpleasing inside canteen area. Canteen staff also face problems in shouting all day. The orders are not in queue, which disturbs synchronousity. Although, they have a token displaying system but they don't use it. Why? On further researching we found out that because the canteen operates in such a large scale, customers tends to ignore the token numbers displayed on screen. 

We are solving this problem by attaching a unique QR code with each receipt. On scanning the QR code, customer can get the status of their order. Moreover, when food is prepared a short notification sound is pushed which notifies users about the order to dine-in and the orders are maintained in queue, so the system becomes efficient. Best part is that no extra work is to be done at canteen's end.
