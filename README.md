# Quick QR Scan System

We are solving a small but big issue of our college, i.e, NIT Jalandhar. "Snackers"- the largest canteen of our college, delivers order by shouting orally. It is unpleasant to ear and canteen staff also waste there energy in shouting all day. Although they have a token displaying system but they don't use it. Why? On further researching we found out that because the canteen operates in such a large scale customers tends to ignore the sound of Order updation. 

We are solving this problem by attaching a unique QR code with each reciept. On scanning the QR code, customer can get the status of their order. Moreover, when food is prepared a short sound is produce which is equal to their oral shouting of orders.
